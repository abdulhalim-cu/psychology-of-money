### **Chapter 20: Confessions**

After 19 chapters of telling you how other people think about and handle money, this is the chapter where Morgan Housel says, "Okay, here's what *I* do."

He shares his personal financial strategy, not as a recommendation for you to copy, but as a real-life demonstration of the principles laid out in the book. The main idea is to show that even for a financial expert, the goal isn't mathematical perfection; it's a "reasonable" system that lets him and his family sleep well at night. It's the ultimate "walk the talk."

#### **Let's Break It Down: How Housel Manages His Own Money**

Here are the key confessions from the author, and you'll see how they tie directly into the lessons from the book:

1.  **His #1 Goal is Independence:** Housel's financial goal isn't a specific number; it's **freedom** (Chapter 7). He wants to be able to wake up every day and control his own time. Every financial decision he makes is measured against this single goal.

2.  **He Has a Very High Savings Rate:** He and his wife saved a huge portion of their income long before he had any real success. They did this by keeping their lifestyle expectations in check. They weren't trying to be "rich"; they were building "wealth" (Chapter 9). This high savings rate is the engine of their independence.

3.  **He Paid Off His Mortgage Early:** From a purely *rational* spreadsheet perspective, this is a bad move. He could have earned higher returns by investing that money in the stock market instead of paying off a low-interest mortgage. But for him, the *reasonable* decision was to be completely debt-free. The psychological return—the peace of mind from knowing he owns his house outright—was more valuable to him than the potential financial return (Chapter 11).

4.  **He Holds a LOT of Cash:** A significant portion of his family's net worth is in cash, sitting in a bank account and earning almost nothing. Again, this is not "rational." But this cash is his ultimate **room for error** (Chapter 13). It ensures that he will *never* be forced to sell his stock investments during a downturn to cover living expenses. It's the price he pays for being able to stay in the game and remain unbreakable (Chapter 5).

5.  **His Investment Strategy is Incredibly Simple:** Housel doesn't try to be a genius stock picker. All of his family's stock market investments are in a handful of **low-cost index funds** (Chapter 6). He doesn't trade. He just buys and holds, with the intention of never selling for decades. He knows he can't predict the future (Chapter 12), so he diversifies and lets compounding do the heavy lifting (Chapter 4).

6.  **He Believes in Long-Term Optimism:** He invests in US and international index funds because he is a rational optimist (Chapter 17). He believes that over the long run, human ingenuity and the desire for progress will lead the world's economy to grow.

#### **How to Apply This in Your Daily Life**

The lesson from this chapter is not to copy Morgan Housel. The lesson is to build a system that works for *you*.

1.  **Don't Copy, Understand the "Why."** The most important part of this chapter is understanding *why* Housel makes these choices. He prioritizes sleeping well at night over maximizing every last dollar. What do you prioritize? Figure that out, and then build your strategy around it.

2.  **Create Your Own "Reasonable" Plan:** Your financial plan should fit your own personality and psychology. If holding lots of stocks makes you anxious, it's okay to hold more cash and bonds, even if a spreadsheet tells you otherwise. Your plan must be one you can stick with (Chapter 11).

3.  **Embrace Simplicity.** The single most liberating message from this chapter is that a financial expert uses a dead-simple strategy. You do not need to be a financial wizard to be successful. A high savings rate and consistent investment in low-cost index funds is a world-class strategy.

4.  **Write Down Your Own Confession.** Try writing a short paragraph describing your financial strategy and the reasons behind it. This act of clarification can be incredibly powerful. It forces you to justify your choices to yourself and solidifies your commitment to your own unique plan, which is the ultimate takeaway from "The Psychology of Money."

**In short:** The author reveals his own simple financial strategy, which is not designed to be optimal but to be reasonable. He prioritizes high savings, peace of mind, and unshakable durability over chasing the highest possible returns, proving that the key to financial success is behavior, not complexity.
