## Chapter Index

1.  **[Chapter 1: No One's Crazy](chapter-01.md)**
    *   *Summary:* Your financial decisions make perfect sense in the context of your own unique life experiences. No one is crazy; we've just all been shown a different movie.

2.  **[Chapter 2: Luck & Risk](chapter-02.md)**
    *   *Summary:* Outcomes are a mix of your effort, luck, and risk. Be humble when you succeed and forgiving when you (or others) fail.

3.  **[Chapter 3: Never Enough](chapter-03.md)**
    *   *Summary:* The hardest and most important financial skill is getting the goalposts to stop moving. Define what "enough" means to you to avoid the dangerous trap of endless social comparison.

4.  **[Chapter 4: Confounding Compounding](chapter-04.md)**
    *   *Summary:* Good investment returns sustained for an uninterrupted period of time are more powerful than great returns for a short time. Time is the real secret to building wealth.

5.  **[Chapter 5: Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy](chapter-05.md)**
    *   *Summary:* Getting wealthy requires taking risks and being optimistic. Staying wealthy requires humility and paranoia. They are two different skills.

6.  **[Chapter 6: Tails, You Win](chapter-06.md)**
    *   *Summary:* A tiny number of outlier events ("tails") account for the majority of results in investing. Diversify to make sure you own the few big winners.

7.  **[Chapter 7: Freedom](chapter-07.md)**
    *   *Summary:* The greatest thing money can buy is control over your own time. This is the highest form of wealth.

8.  **[Chapter 8: Man in the Car Paradox](chapter-08.md)**
    *   *Summary:* No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are. Don't waste money trying to buy respect that you'll never receive.

9.  **[Chapter 9: Wealth is What You Don't See](chapter-09.md)**
    *   *Summary:* Stop equating richness (visible spending) with wealth (invisible savings). True wealth is what you *don't* spend, and it's what buys you freedom.

10. **[Chapter 10: Save Money](chapter-10.md)**
    *   *Summary:* Don't just save for specific goals. Save for a world that is guaranteed to surprise you. A high savings rate is your best protection.

11. **[Chapter 11: Reasonable > Rational](chapter-11.md)**
    *   *Summary:* The best financial plan is not the one that's perfect on a spreadsheet, but the one you can actually stick with through thick and thin.

12. **[Chapter 12: Surprise!](chapter-12.md)**
    *   *Summary:* History's biggest events are always surprises. Don't try to predict them; prepare for them by building a margin of safety into your life.

13. **[Chapter 13: Room for Error](chapter-13.md)**
    *   *Summary:* Build a buffer into your financial plan. The most important part of a plan is planning for it *not* to go according to plan.

14. **[Chapter 14: You'll Change](chapter-14.md)**
    *   *Summary:* Avoid extreme long-term plans because you are terrible at predicting what your future self will want. Prioritize flexibility over locking yourself in.

*(More chapter summaries will be added as they are completed.)*
