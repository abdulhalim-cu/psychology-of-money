### **Chapter 14: You'll Change**

Think back to the person you were ten years ago. Your hobbies, your goals, your taste in music, your career ambitionsâ€”how many of them are the same today? Probably not many. We are constantly evolving.

Now, project yourself ten years into the future. It's very difficult to imagine how different that future person will be. We tend to think that the person we are *right now* is the finished product, and our future self will just be a slightly older version who wants all the same things.

The main idea of this chapter is that **we are terrible at predicting our future selves.** This is a huge problem for long-term financial planning, because we are essentially making plans for a stranger. The life that your 25-year-old self wants might be completely different from the life your 45-year-old self actually enjoys. This is called the "end-of-history illusion."

#### **Let's Break It Down with an Example**

Imagine a young lawyer, let's call him Mark, who is 28 years old.

*   **Mark's Current Plan:** Mark is ambitious and driven. His goal is to become a partner at a top law firm. He is willing to work 80-hour weeks for the next 20 years to achieve this. His entire financial plan is built around this goal: he buys a fancy apartment near his downtown office, leases a luxury car to project success, and justifies his extreme work hours by telling himself, "It will all be worth it when I'm 50 and rich." He is locking himself into a very specific, high-cost, high-stress life path.

*   **Mark at Age 40:** After 12 years of grinding, Mark is successful but also burned out. He has a family now. The 80-hour weeks are taking a huge toll. The downtown apartment feels cramped. What he *truly* wants now is not more prestige, but more time with his kids and a less stressful job. He daydreams about moving to the suburbs and maybe teaching law instead.

The problem? The 28-year-old Mark made huge, long-term financial commitments (the expensive apartment, the lifestyle) based on the desires of his younger self. Now, the 40-year-old Mark feels trapped. He's anchored to a life he no longer wants because of decisions made by a person he no longer is.

This is the danger of making extreme, long-term plans. We change, and locking ourselves into a single vision of the future can lead to immense regret.

#### **How to Apply This in Your Daily Life**

This is a powerful argument against extreme financial plans and in favor of balance and flexibility.

1.  **Avoid Extreme Financial Plans.** This applies to both ends of the spectrum.
    *   **Extreme Spending:** Don't saddle your future self with massive debt (huge mortgage, expensive car loans) for a lifestyle you might not even want in a decade.
    *   **Extreme Frugality:** Don't sacrifice every ounce of joy in your 20s and 30s with the idea that you'll finally live it up in your 60s. Your 60-year-old self might have different priorities or health limitations. You need to find a balance between planning for the future and living a decent life today.

2.  **Prioritize Flexibility in Your Decisions.** When making big life choices, try to choose the path that keeps the most doors open.
    *   Instead of buying the biggest house you can possibly afford, maybe buy a more modest one. This gives you the future flexibility to move, change careers, or work less if you want to.
    *   Instead of putting all your savings into a complex investment you can't touch for 30 years, make sure you also have accessible savings (Chapter 13's "room for error") that give you options.

3.  **Recognize the Power of "Sunk Costs."** A sunk cost is money you've already spent that you can't get back. We often stick with a bad plan because we don't want to "waste" the effort or money we've already put in. Mark, the lawyer, might stick with his miserable job because he's already invested 12 years of his life. Learning to recognize that your past self's choices shouldn't dictate your future self's happiness is a superpower. It's okay to change your mind and walk away.

4.  **Embrace the Middle Ground.** The best path for most people is a balanced one. Save a reasonable percentage of your income, but also spend enough to enjoy the journey. Invest for the long term, but keep some cash on hand for flexibility. This "middle of the road" approach is less likely to lead to regret, because it works pretty well for whatever version of you shows up in the future.

---
**In short:** The person you are today is not the person you will be in 10 or 20 years. Accept this fact and avoid locking your future self into extreme plans made by your past self. Build a balanced financial life that gives you flexibility, because the goals you have today might not be the goals that make you happy tomorrow.
