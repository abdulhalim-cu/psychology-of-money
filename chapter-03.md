### **Chapter 3: Never Enough**

Have you ever thought to yourself, "If I just earned a little more," or "If I just had a bit more saved up, *then* I'd finally feel secure and happy"?

This chapter is about the dangerous trap of "moving the goalposts." It’s about people who achieve incredible wealth and success but end up destroying it all because they can't stop. They don't have a sense of **enough**. The hardest, but most important, financial skill is getting the goalposts to stop moving.

#### **Let's Break It Down with a Real-World Case**

The book tells the stunning story of a man named **Rajat Gupta.**

*   **Who was he?** Rajat Gupta was a true superstar. He grew up an orphan in India and rose to become the CEO of McKinsey & Company, one of the most prestigious consulting firms in the world. He was on the board of directors for major companies like Goldman Sachs and was worth an estimated **$100 million.** By any sane measure, he had won the game of life.

*   **What did he do?** Despite having more money than he could ever spend, he wanted to be a *billionaire*. He was surrounded by hedge fund managers and investment bankers who made hundreds of millions a year, and his $100 million started to feel small in comparison. So, in 2008, he used his position on the Goldman Sachs board to engage in illegal insider trading, feeding secret information to a hedge fund manager to make a quick profit.

*   **The Result:** He was caught. His reputation was instantly destroyed. He was convicted, fined millions, and sent to prison.

**Think about that for a moment.** He already had everything: immense wealth, prestige, freedom, and the respect of his family and peers. He risked all of that—the things he *had* and *needed*—for something he didn't have and absolutely did not need (more money). This is the insanity of "Never Enough."

The author contrasts this with a famous story about two writers, Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller (author of *Catch-22*).

At a party hosted by a billionaire, Vonnegut told Heller that their host had made more money in a single day than Heller had ever made from his famous novel.
Heller replied, **"Yes, but I have something he will never have... enough."**

#### **How to Apply This in Your Daily Life**

This lesson is less about spreadsheets and more about your soul. It's critical for long-term well-being.

1.  **Define Your Own "Enough."** The most important financial planning exercise you can do is to sit down and define what "enough" means to you. It's not just a number. It’s a lifestyle. What does money need to *do* for you?
    *   Does it mean not worrying about a surprise car repair bill?
    *   Does it mean having the freedom to quit a job you hate?
    *   Does it mean being able to take a vacation once a year without going into debt?
    Once you know the "why," you can avoid the endless, soul-crushing pursuit of "more" for its own sake.

2.  **Stop the Comparison Game (Especially on Social Media).** The root of "Never Enough" is social comparison. You feel poor not because of what you have, but because of what you see others have. Social media is an engine for this. Remember: you are seeing their highlight reel, not their bloopers (or their credit card debt). The only financial comparison that matters is with your past self. Are you in a better position today than you were last year?

3.  **Remember the Golden Rule:** Housel states it perfectly: **"There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need."**
    *   **What you have and need:** Your reputation, your freedom, your family, your friends, your happiness.
    *   **What you don't have and don't need:** The extra bit of money that won't materially change your life but could cost you everything. Don't make reckless investments or career choices chasing "more" when you already have "enough."

4.  **Recognize that the Hunger for "More" is a Form of Addiction.** Like any addiction, it will promise happiness but never deliver. True wealth isn't about having the fanciest car; it's about waking up and knowing you have control over your time and your life. That's a feeling no amount of money can buy if you're stuck on the treadmill of "more."
