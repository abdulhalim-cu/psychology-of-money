### **Chapter 11: Reasonable > Rational**

When it comes to money, we're often told to be **rational**. This means making decisions based on cold, hard numbers and formulas, like a robot or a character from Star Trek. "The math says this is the optimal choice, so you must do it."

This chapter argues that trying to be perfectly rational is a terrible strategy. Instead, we should aim to be **reasonable**.

A *rational* decision might look perfect on a spreadsheet but is emotionally impossible to stick with in the real world. A *reasonable* decision is one that is "pretty good" but, more importantly, is one you can actually follow through with over the long run, especially when you're feeling scared or greedy. The best financial plan is not the most optimal one, but the one you will actually stick with.

#### **Let's Break It Down with an Example**

Let's imagine two investors planning for retirement.

*   **Investor A ("Rational Rob"):** Rob studies historical market data. His research shows that, over the very long term, a portfolio made up of 100% stocks has provided the highest possible return. From a purely mathematical and rational standpoint, this is the "best" strategy. So, Rob puts every single dollar of his retirement savings into stocks.

*   **Investor B ("Reasonable Rita"):** Rita also knows that stocks have the best long-term returns. But she also knows herself. She knows that watching her account balance drop by 40% would cause her immense stress and panic. So, she chooses a *reasonable* strategy: she invests 80% in stocks and 20% in boring, stable bonds. A spreadsheet would tell her this is "sub-optimal" because the bonds will lower her overall potential return.

**Then, a major market crash happens.** The stock market plummets 40%.

*   **Rational Rob's** all-stock portfolio gets absolutely crushed. The numbers on his screen are terrifying. All his cold rationality evaporates, replaced by pure fear. He can't stomach the losses anymore and thinks, "I need to get out before it goes to zero!" He sells everything at the bottom, turning a temporary paper loss into a permanent, devastating real-world loss. His "perfect" rational plan completely failed because it didn't account for real human emotion.

*   **Reasonable Rita's** portfolio also drops, but not as badly. Her 20% in bonds acted as a cushion, so her total loss might only be around 30%. It's still painful, but it's *manageable*. Because the fall wasn't as catastrophic, she feels secure enough to stick with her plan. She doesn't sell, and when the market eventually recovers, her wealth recovers with it.

**Who won?** Rita, with her "imperfect" but reasonable plan, ended up far ahead because she was able to stick with it. Sticking to a good plan is infinitely better than abandoning a perfect one.

#### **How to Apply This in Your Daily Life**

This is about designing a financial life that fits *you*, not one that fits a textbook.

1.  **Prioritize Your Peace of Mind.** The best investment strategy for you is the one that lets you sleep at night. If investing all your money in stocks makes you anxious, then don't do it! It's perfectly reasonable to hold a larger amount of cash or bonds than is "optimal" if it prevents you from making a panic-driven mistake later.

2.  **Don't Be a Financial Puritan.** You don't have to be perfect. Is it mathematically optimal to pay off your 3% mortgage early instead of investing? No. But if being completely debt-free gives you a profound sense of security and happiness, then it's a perfectly *reasonable* thing to do. Your goal is to improve your life, not to win a math competition.

3.  **Choose Strategies That Are Easy to Maintain.** Complex strategies are the first to be abandoned in a crisis. A simple, reasonable plan like "automatically contribute 15% of my paycheck to a low-cost S&P 500 index fund every month, no matter what" is far more powerful than a complex day-trading strategy because you are more likely to do it consistently for 50 years.

4.  **Embrace "Good Enough."** Don't chase perfection. You don't need the absolute best-performing fund of the last five years. You just need a good, diversified fund that you can buy and hold forever. The quest for "optimal" often leads people to constantly change strategies, which is a sure way to underperform.

**In short:** Don't aim for the cold, rational perfection of a spreadsheet. Aim for a sensible, reasonable strategy that you are comfortable with and can stick to through thick and thin. A plan you can follow is always better than a plan that will eventually break you.
