### **Chapter 6: Tails, You Win**

Have you ever felt like you need to be a genius who makes the right decision every single time to be a successful investor? This chapter is here to tell you that's completely wrong.

The reality is that in many areas of life, especially investing, a tiny number of events are responsible for the majority of the results. This is called a "tail" event—a rare, outlier event that has a massive impact.

Think of it like a baseball player's career. A Hall of Fame hitter might only get a hit 3 out of every 10 times at bat. They "fail" most of the time. But a few of those hits are game-winning home runs that define their entire career. In investing, you can be wrong most of the time, but if you are right just a few times in a huge way, you will win.

The main idea is: **A few big winners will account for almost all of your investment gains. The rest of your investments will be mediocre or even losers, and that's not just okay—it's normal.**

#### **Let's Break It Down with Real-World Cases**

**Case 1: Venture Capital (VC) Investing**

Venture capitalists are professionals who invest in brand-new startup companies. Their entire business model is a perfect example of "Tails, You Win."

*   A VC firm will invest in, say, 50 different startups.
*   Over the next decade, what happens?
    *   Maybe 30 of them will go bankrupt and be worth $0. **(Complete failures)**
    *   Another 15 might survive but not really grow, eventually being sold for a small profit or loss. **(Mediocre)**
    *   Maybe 4 of them will do well, returning 5x or 10x the initial investment. **(Good wins)**
    *   But **one** of them might be the next Uber, Airbnb, or Google. That single company will return 1,000x or more, and its success will pay for *all the other failures combined* and generate the firm's entire profit.

That one massive success is the "tail" event. The VCs know they can't predict which one it will be, so their strategy isn't to pick the one winner. Their strategy is to invest in enough companies to guarantee they have a shot at owning one of these rare, explosive winners.

**Case 2: The Regular Stock Market**

This isn't just for startups; it's true for everyday investors, too. The book cites a study of the Russell 3000 Index (which represents most of the US stock market). The results are shocking:

*   40% of all the stocks in the index effectively went to zero over time (they were total losers).
*   Most of the stocks had mediocre returns.
*   But a tiny handful of stocks—about 7% of them—were "mega-winners" that performed spectacularly.

The entire return of the whole stock market was driven by that tiny group of superstars. If you missed out on owning those few companies, your returns would have been terrible.

#### **How to Apply This in Your Daily Life**

This concept is the single best argument for a simple and effective investment strategy.

1.  **Diversify. Diversify. Diversify.** Since you can't possibly know which companies will be the "tail" winners, the smartest thing you can do is own a little piece of all of them. How do you do that? **Buy a low-cost index fund.**
    *   An S&P 500 index fund, for example, lets you own a small piece of the 500 largest US companies. By owning the whole "haystack," you are guaranteed to own the few "needles" that will drive all the growth. Trying to find the needles yourself is a fool's errand.

2.  **Be Okay with Having Losers in Your Portfolio.** If you own an index fund and see that some of the companies in it are doing poorly, don't panic. That's part of the process! The losers don't matter. The big winners will more than make up for them. Your portfolio isn't a report card where every stock needs to get an 'A'.

3.  **Give Your Winners Room to Run.** A common mistake is to sell a stock after it has doubled, just to "lock in a profit." But the "tail" winners don't just double; they can grow 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x over many years. Selling your winners early is like pulling your flowers to water your weeds. Let your winners do their job. An index fund does this for you automatically.

In short: Anything that is huge, profitable, famous, or influential is the result of a tail event. Your job as an investor is not to be a hero and find those tails yourself, but simply to be patient and diversified enough to make sure you capture them when they happen.
